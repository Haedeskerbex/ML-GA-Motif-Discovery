MissingOutputException in rule fetch_data in file /home/ram/MajorProject/ML-GA-Motif-Discovery/mutation_predictor/Snakefile, line 7:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
db/sequences.db (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
